- Power Analyzer V2 main commit
Known issues: 
- Touch-IC doesn't reset properly (maybe because of signal guard),
  which leads to a double touch when changing directions
- frequency measurements somehow don't work anymore, could be because of the longer delay due to 
  enables.
- The RMS measurements sometimes jump to the max value that can be measured by the configuration.
  Probably because of the RMS calculation done in the chip.

ToDo:
- DataLogger is prepared, but not yet implemented. Data acquision for long-term measurements has 
  to be timed correctly and a configuration interface for the GUI is open.
- move data readout in a separate function. Better interaction with FFT sampling.
